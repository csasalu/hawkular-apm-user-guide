== Trace Fragment Reporter

When a link:../apiref/rest-apm.html#Trace[_Trace_] fragment has been built, as the result of instrumenting and processing activity caused by an application being invoked, it will be reported to a local component responsible for delivering the information to the APM (Application Performance Management) server.

To ensure that the fragment information is reported to the server in the most efficient manner, it will be batched and sent to the server when one of two situations occur:

* a number of millseconds, defined in the *HAWKULAR_APM_COLLECTOR_BATCHTIME* environment variable, expires

* the batch size exceeds the value defined in the *HAWKULAR_APM_COLLECTOR_BATCHSIZE* environment variable

Fragments are reported to the server via the link:../apiref/rest-apm.html#POST__fragments[REST API].

NOTE: Other communication mechanisms will be supported in the future.
